## Summary
This Flow Chart was originally uploaded to stackoverflow in .PNG format [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/471432/in-which-scenario-do-i-use-a-particular-stl-container/22671607#22671607). Since no editable version of the Flow Chart existed, I created one so that programmers, learning about data structures and algorithms, like myself, could create their own variations with ease.
